# User Deletion Fix - Foreign Key Constraint Issue

## Problem

When attempting to delete a user, the application was encountering a foreign key constraint error:

```
IntegrityError at /users/2/delete/
FOREIGN KEY constraint failed
```

This error occurred because not all relationships between the user and other database objects were being properly handled during the deletion process.

## Root Cause

The main issue was with the many-to-many relationship between the `Goal` model and the `Category` model. When deleting a user's goals, we were not clearing the many-to-many relationships first, which led to foreign key constraint violations.

In Django, many-to-many relationships are stored in a separate join table. When deleting an object that has many-to-many relationships, those relationships need to be cleared before the object can be deleted, or the database will raise a foreign key constraint error.

## Solution

The solution was to modify the `delete_user` view to clear the many-to-many relationships between goals and categories before deleting the goals. This was done by adding the following line of code for each goal:


## Implementation Details

The complete implementation now follows this order of operations:

1. Start a database transaction (using `@transaction.atomic`)
2. For each goal belonging to the user:
   - Clear the many-to-many relationship with categories
   - Delete tasks related to the goal
   - Delete progress updates related to the goal
   - Delete hour logs related to the goal
   - Delete the goal itself
3. Delete user tasks
4. Delete the user's profile
5. Finally, delete the user

This ensures that all related objects are properly deleted in the correct order, preventing any foreign key constraint violations.

## Additional Improvements

The error handling was also enhanced to provide more detailed information about any exceptions that might occur during the deletion process. This includes using `traceback.format_exc()` to capture the full stack trace, which helps with debugging any future issues.

# Dashboard Consistency Changes

## Overview

This document outlines the changes made to ensure consistency in references to the dashboard functionality throughout the application. Previously, there were inconsistencies where some parts of the code referred to the main page as "home" while others referred to it as "dashboard". All references have now been standardized to use "dashboard" for consistency.

## Changes Made

### View Functions

1. Renamed the `home` view function to `dashboard`
2. Removed the redundant `dashboard` view function that simply redirected to 'home'
3. Updated the template reference in the dashboard view from 'home.html' to 'dashboard.html'

### URL Patterns

1. Updated the root URL pattern to use the `dashboard` view function instead of `home`
2. Updated the URL name from 'home' to 'dashboard'
3. Removed the redundant '/dashboard/' URL pattern

### Redirects

1. Updated all redirects from 'home' to 'dashboard' in the following functions:
   - `login_view`
   - `register`
   - `logout_view`
   - `delete_user`

### Templates

1. Created a new 'dashboard.html' template based on 'home.html' with updated title
2. Updated all template references from 'home' to 'dashboard' in 'base.html':
   - Navbar brand link
   - Main menu dropdown item
   - User dropdown menu item

## Benefits

These changes ensure consistency throughout the application, making the codebase more maintainable and the user experience more coherent. Users will now see consistent references to "Dashboard" in the UI, and developers will find consistent naming in the codebase.
